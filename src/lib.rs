//! Fancy pure Rust crypto and hash library.
//!
//! The main reason this exists is so I can learn about cryptography.
//!
//! If you're asking "We have rust-crypto, why the hell do we need a new
//! library?"), `rust-crypto` was (at the time of Octavo's creation) big pile of… mess. To be honest
//! I doesn't hate `rust-crypto` but I wanted something that will be organized in fancy way, not
//! another OpenSSL (but written in Rust, so probably less buggy).
//!
//! Anther reason is that I want Octavo to became highly configurable via Cargo features. Each
//! cipher, hash family, MAC, etc. should be behind a feature.
//!
//! Oh… one more thing. I want to create C wrapper for Octavo (maybe even OpenSSL compatible), so
//! that you could use this beautiful peace of crap.
//!
//! Happy coding!
//!
//! ## Examples
